## What's LXC?

>LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features.
Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create
and manage system or application containers.

## Features

Current LXC uses the following kernel features to contain processes:

* Kernel namespaces (ipc, uts, mount, pid, network and user)

* Apparmor and SELinux profiles

* Seccomp policies

* Chroots (using pivot_root)

* Kernel capabilities

* CGroups (control groups)

LXC containers are often considered as something in the middle between a chroot and
a full fledged virtual machine. The goal of LXC is to create an environment as close as possible
to a standard Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.

## Components

LXC is currently made of a few separate components:

* The liblxc library

* Several language bindings for the API:

>python3 (in-tree, long term support in 1.0.x and 2.0.x)

>lua (in tree, long term support in 1.0.x and 2.0.x)

>[Go](https://github.com/lxc/go-lxc)
    
>[ruby](https://github.com/lxc/ruby-lxc)

>[python2](https://github.com/lxc/python2-lxc)

>[Haskell](https://github.com/fizruk/lxc)

* A set of standard tools to control the containers

* Distribution container templates
