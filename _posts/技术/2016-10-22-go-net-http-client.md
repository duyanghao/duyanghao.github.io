go net/http Client使用总结

###Client数据结构
```go
// A Client is an HTTP client. Its zero value (DefaultClient) is a
// usable client that uses DefaultTransport.
//
// The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP
// connections), so Clients should be reused instead of created as
// needed. Clients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport)
// and additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and
// redirects.
type Client struct {
	// Transport specifies the mechanism by which individual
	// HTTP requests are made.
	// If nil, DefaultTransport is used.
	Transport RoundTripper

	// CheckRedirect specifies the policy for handling redirects.
	// If CheckRedirect is not nil, the client calls it before
	// following an HTTP redirect. The arguments req and via are
	// the upcoming request and the requests made already, oldest
	// first. If CheckRedirect returns an error, the Client's Get
	// method returns both the previous Response (with its Body
	// closed) and CheckRedirect's error (wrapped in a url.Error)
	// instead of issuing the Request req.
	// As a special case, if CheckRedirect returns ErrUseLastResponse,
	// then the most recent response is returned with its body
	// unclosed, along with a nil error.
	//
	// If CheckRedirect is nil, the Client uses its default policy,
	// which is to stop after 10 consecutive requests.
	CheckRedirect func(req *Request, via []*Request) error

	// Jar specifies the cookie jar.
	// If Jar is nil, cookies are not sent in requests and ignored
	// in responses.
	Jar CookieJar

	// Timeout specifies a time limit for requests made by this
	// Client. The timeout includes connection time, any
	// redirects, and reading the response body. The timer remains
	// running after Get, Head, Post, or Do return and will
	// interrupt reading of the Response.Body.
	//
	// A Timeout of zero means no timeout.
	//
	// The Client cancels requests to the underlying Transport
	// using the Request.Cancel mechanism. Requests passed
	// to Client.Do may still set Request.Cancel; both will
	// cancel the request.
	//
	// For compatibility, the Client will also use the deprecated
	// CancelRequest method on Transport if found. New
	// RoundTripper implementations should use Request.Cancel
	// instead of implementing CancelRequest.
	Timeout time.Duration
}
