## Overview

Kubernetes disaster-recovery is an essential feature in the production environment, and there are two things we want to backup for kubernetes:

* Kuberentes data: Kubernetes stores its state in etcd, so we can backup etcd for this purpose.
* Application data: i.e. volumes, we want to use velero for this purpose(this is what I want to talk about in this post).

Indeed, we can customize the backup method for each of applications, such as `mysqldump` for `MySQL` or `MariaDB`, `bgsave` for `Redis` and so on, and that what we actually did in the past. The advantage of this approach is that we can ignore the low-level storage details while the obvious drawback is that the workload for specifying backup methods continues to increase as the number of applications grows, which makes it hard to maintain and automate the backup.      

To solve this problem, we need to find an uniform way to do `bur`(backup and restore) regardless of the type of application and [Kubernetes Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes), and velero comes into our sight.

## Velero Introduction

Velero (formerly Heptio Ark) gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. You can run Velero with a cloud provider or on-premises. Velero lets you:

* Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
* Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
* Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.

Velero consists of:

* A server that runs on your cluster
* A command-line client that runs locally

Each Velero operation -- on-demand backup, scheduled backup, restore -- is a custom resource, defined with a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and stored in etcd. Velero also includes controllers that process the custom resources to perform backups, restores, and all related operations.

You can back up or restore all objects in your cluster, or you can filter objects by type, namespace, and/or label.

Velero is ideal for the disaster recovery use case, as well as for snapshotting your application state, prior to performing system operations on your cluster (e.g. upgrades).

## Velero Backup Workflow

When you run velero backup create test-backup:

1. The Velero client makes a call to the Kubernetes API server to create a Backup object.
2. The BackupController notices the new Backup object and performs validation.
3. The BackupController begins the backup process. It collects the data to back up by querying the API server for resources.
4. The BackupController makes a call to the object storage service -- for example, AWS S3 -- to upload the backup file.

By default, velero backup create makes disk snapshots of any persistent volumes. You can adjust the snapshots by specifying additional flags. Run velero backup create --help to see available flags. Snapshots can be disabled with the option --snapshot-volumes=false.

## Methods to back up the contents of volumes

Refers to [velero backup Kubernetes Persistent Volume failed with minio](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/2355)

>> for backing up the contents of volumes you have two options:

>> Use a volumesnapshotter plugin to take native snapshots of your volumes. This would work if you are running in AWS proper, and you have EBS volumes that you want to take snapshots of.

>> Use [velero's restic integration](https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.1/restic/) to take file-level backups of the contents of your volumes. You can use this to back up any type of volume (except hostPath).

Since some volume types may not have a native snapshot concept or there is no relevant snapshot plugin for the storage platform we are using yet, let's switch to [velero's restic integration](https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.1/restic/) method.  

## [How does velero backup and restore work with restic](https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.1/restic/)

Let's introduce three custom resource definitions and associated controllers:
* `ResticRepository` - represents/manages the lifecycle of Velero's [restic repositories](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#terminology). Velero creates a restic repository per namespace when the first restic backup for a namespace is requested. The controller for this custom resource executes restic repository lifecycle commands -- `restic init`, `restic check`, and `restic prune`.
* `PodVolumeBackup` - represents a restic backup of a volume in a pod. The main Velero backup process creates one or more of these when it finds an annotated pod. Each node in the cluster runs a controller for this resource (in a daemonset) that handles the PodVolumeBackups for pods on that node. The controller executes `restic backup` commands to backup pod volume data.
* `PodVolumeRestore` - represents a restic restore of a pod volume. The main Velero restore process creates one or more of these when it encounters a pod that has associated restic backups. Each node in the cluster runs a controller for this resource (in the same daemonset as above) that handles the `PodVolumeRestores` for pods on that node. The controller executes `restic restore` commands to restore pod volume data.

#### Backup

1. The main Velero backup process checks each pod that it's backing up for the annotation specifying a restic backup should be taken (`backup.velero.io/backup-volumes`)
2. When found, Velero first ensures a restic repository exists for the pod's namespace, by:
  * checking if a `ResticRepository` custom resource already exists
  * if not, creating a new one, and waiting for the `ResticRepository` controller to init/check it
3. Velero then creates a `PodVolumeBackup` custom resource per volume listed in the pod annotation
4. The main Velero process now waits for the `PodVolumeBackup` resources to complete or fail
5. Meanwhile, each `PodVolumeBackup` is handled by the controller on the appropriate node, which:
  * has a hostPath volume mount of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to access the pod volume data
  * finds the pod volume's subdirectory within the above volume
  * runs `restic backup`
  * updates the status of the custom resource to `Completed` or `Failed`
6. As each `PodVolumeBackup` finishes, the main Velero process adds it to the Velero backup in a file named `<backup-name>-podvolumebackups.json.gz`. This file gets uploaded to object storage alongside the backup tarball. It will be used for restores, as seen in the next section.

#### Restore

1. The main Velero restore process checks each existing `PodVolumeBackup` custom resource in the cluster to backup from.
2. For each `PodVolumeBackup` found, Velero first ensures a restic repository exists for the pod's namespace, by:
  * checking if a `ResticRepository` custom resource already exists
  * if not, creating a new one, and waiting for the `ResticRepository` controller to init/check it (note that in this case, the actual repository should already exist in object storage, so the Velero controller will simply check it for integrity)
3. Velero adds an init container to the pod, whose job is to wait for all restic restores for the pod to complete (more on this shortly)
4. Velero creates the pod, with the added init container, by submitting it to the Kubernetes API
5. Velero creates a `PodVolumeRestore` custom resource for each volume to be restored in the pod
6. The main Velero process now waits for each `PodVolumeRestore` resource to complete or fail
7. Meanwhile, each `PodVolumeRestore` is handled by the controller on the appropriate node, which:
  * has a hostPath volume mount of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to access the pod volume data
  * waits for the pod to be running the init container
  * finds the pod volume's subdirectory within the above volume
  * runs `restic restore`
  * on success, writes a file into the pod volume, in a .velero subdirectory, whose name is the UID of the Velero restore that this pod volume restore is for
  * updates the status of the custom resource to `Completed` or `Failed`
8. The init container that was added to the pod is running a process that waits until it finds a file within each restored volume, under `.velero`, whose name is the UID of the Velero restore being run
9. Once all such files are found, the init container's process terminates successfully and the pod moves on to running other init containers/the main containers.

## Kubernetes cluster BUR Process with Restic Integration

We can backup Kubernetes cluster regularly and restore it when disaster happens as below:

1. Add annotations for pods with persistent volumes by hand
2. Create velero backup(including pods and relevant volumes) for the cluster
3. Delete the whole Kubernetes cluster(simulate a disaster)
4. Install a new Kubernetes Cluster and velero with the same storage provider as before
5. Wait velero backup to appear in the new Kubernetes cluster
6. Do velero restore
7. Check the new Kubernetes cluster state(Kuberentes data&&Application data) - whether or not the same state as before

## Some thought about velero with Restic Integration

* Incremental backup

An incremental backup chain will be maintained across pod reschedules for PVCs. However, for pod volumes that are not PVCs, such as emptyDir volumes, when a pod is deleted/recreated (e.g. by a ReplicaSet/Deployment), the next backup of those volumes will be full rather than incremental, because the pod volume's lifecycle is assumed to be defined by its pod.

* Application influence during backup

There is no influence since the application is completely unaware of the restic backup, but the possibility of inconsistency of data always exists.
  
* Performance
 
Restic scans each file in a single thread. This means that large files (such as ones storing a database) will take a long time to scan for data deduplication, even if the actual difference is small.

#### [velero-volume-controller](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/master/site/docs/master/restic.md#add-backup-annotation) 

Since one drawback of velero with Restic Integration is that we have to add relevant annotation for pods with persistent volumes by hand for backing up application data and meanwhile the velero official hasn't provided a solution to backup all volume resources in the cluster yet.

To solve this, I have created a repo called [velero-volume-controller](https://github.com/duyanghao/velero-volume-controller), which helps users to do this dull job automatically as below:

As you can can, the requirements for switching between underlying storage providers list below:

1. Same StorageClassName 
2. Support relevant access modes of persistent volume(i.e. RWO, ROX and RWX)

#### [Backup Big Data](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/1515)

When backing up big data, such as 100G or more, velero backup will fail as below: 

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test100g bs=1M count=102400
$ kubectl cp test100g test/nginx-deployment-7f6f89ddbf-lq245:/var/log/nginx/
$ kubectl -n test annotate pods/nginx-deployment-7f6f89ddbf-4bxrn backup.velero.io/backup-volumes=nginx-logs
$ velero backup create big-data-test --include-namespaces test
# PartiallyFailed
$ velero backup get
big-data-test                   PartiallyFailed (1 error)   2020-03-26 15:54:00 +0800 CST   25d       default            <none>
$ velero backup describe big-data-test

Expiration:  2020-04-25 15:54:00 +0800 CST

Persistent Volumes: <none included>

Restic Backups (specify --details for more information):
  Completed:  1

# podvolumebackups end with normal 'Completion' Phase  
$ kubectl describe podvolumebackups/big-data-test-t5r76 -nvelero
[...truncate...]
Status:
  Completion Timestamp:  2020-03-26T09:20:40Z

```

The default value of restic_timeout is one hour, we can increase this for large migrations, keeping in mind that a higher value may delay the return of error messages.

```bash
# increase the timeout value -- under the args section of the velero deployment as below:
[...truncate...]
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - server
        - --restic-timeout=3h
        command:
        - /velero
```

Now restic backup successfully as below:

```bash
$ velero backup get

#### <font color="#dd0000">Backup concurrently</font><br />

Right now, velevo restic has not supported running restic backups concurrently as below:

```bash
$ velero backup describe multiple-test --details
[...truncate...]
Started:    2020-04-02 16:02:28 +0800 CST

  In Progress:
    test-100/nginx-deployment-7f6f89ddbf-qjhvt: nginx-logs (85.55%)
```

And you can get more information about this [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/2122). 

#### <font color="#dd0000">High-availability</font><br />

>> Currently, Velero does not support multiple replicas of the server.
   
>> We're looking at ways to address making it more concurrent and highly available, including a design for [worker pods](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pull/1653), making one pod or job per backup/restore.
   
>> That does still leave challenges for the server loops that handle dispatching the Backup and Restores to the workers, though. Some ideas for addressing that are discussed in [#487](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/487).   

#### <font color="#dd0000">Incremental backup</font><br />

```bash
# test1 - single big file(100G)
# loop-1 - 42m
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test100G bs=1M count=102400
# loop-2 - 37m
$ echo "hello world" >> test100G
# loop-3 (unchanged) - 17s
# loop-4 - 42s
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test1G bs=1M count=1024
# test1 shows that the restic backup is incremental but time token to scan for data deduplication increases as file size grows   

# test2 - multiple files within one persistent volume(10W-1M files)
# loop-1 - 10m
# loop-2(+1M) - 17s
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test1M bs=1M count=1
# loop-3(+1G) - 17s
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test1G bs=1M count=1024
# loop-4(delete serveral files) - 18s
# loop-5(delete all files) - 3s
# attention: backup data in object storage provider still remains

# test3 - pod restart(17s)
# test3 shows that an incremental backup chain will be maintained across pod reschedules for PVCs.
```

#### <font color="#dd0000">Delete policy</font><br />

`velero restic backup delete` will remove relevant backup, restore and disk snapshots，but it won't delete restic data or affect other backups

```bash
$ velero backup create delete-policy-2 --include-namespaces test4
$ velero backup create delete-policy-3 --include-namespaces test4
194.70.0.1 - - [07/Apr/2020:11:39:36 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.29.0" "-"
$ velero backup delete delete-policy-2
Request to delete backup "delete-policy-2" submitted successfully.
The backup will be fully deleted after all associated data (disk snapshots, backup files, restores) are removed.
$ kubectl delete ns test4
$ velero restore create --from-backup delete-policy-3
194.70.0.1 - - [07/Apr/2020:11:39:36 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.29.0" "-"
```

Let's do a simple test with [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs) as below:

```bash
