excerpt: ​This article introduces a Cloud Native backup and restore tool - Velero
---

## Overview

We want to find a way to do `bur`(backup and restore) regardless of [the type of Kubernetes Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes).

## How Velero Works

Each Velero operation -- on-demand backup, scheduled backup, restore -- is a custom resource, defined with a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and stored in etcd. Velero also includes controllers that process the custom resources to perform backups, restores, and all related operations.

You can back up or restore all objects in your cluster, or you can filter objects by type, namespace, and/or label.

Velero is ideal for the disaster recovery use case, as well as for snapshotting your application state, prior to performing system operations on your cluster (e.g. upgrades).

## Backup workflow

When you run velero backup create test-backup:

1. The Velero client makes a call to the Kubernetes API server to create a Backup object.
2. The BackupController notices the new Backup object and performs validation.
3. The BackupController begins the backup process. It collects the data to back up by querying the API server for resources.
4. The BackupController makes a call to the object storage service -- for example, AWS S3 -- to upload the backup file.

By default, velero backup create makes disk snapshots of any persistent volumes. You can adjust the snapshots by specifying additional flags. Run velero backup create --help to see available flags. Snapshots can be disabled with the option --snapshot-volumes=false.

## Methods to back up the contents of volumes

Refers to [velero backup Kubernetes Persistent Volume failed with minio](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/2355)

>> for backing up the contents of volumes you have two options:

>> Use a volumesnapshotter plugin to take native snapshots of your volumes. This would work if you are running in AWS proper, and you have EBS volumes that you want to take snapshots of.

>> Use [velero's restic integration](https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.1/restic/) to take file-level backups of the contents of your volumes. You can use this to back up any type of volume (except hostPath).

Since some volume types may not have a native snapshot concept or there is no relevant snapshot plugin for the storage platform we are using yet, let's switch to [velero's restic integration](https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.1/restic/) method.  

## [How does velero backup and restore work with restic](https://velero.io/docs/v1.3.1/restic/)

Let's introduce three custom resource definitions and associated controllers:
* `ResticRepository` - represents/manages the lifecycle of Velero's [restic repositories](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_references.html#terminology). Velero creates a restic repository per namespace when the first restic backup for a namespace is requested. The controller for this custom resource executes restic repository lifecycle commands -- `restic init`, `restic check`, and `restic prune`.
* `PodVolumeBackup` - represents a restic backup of a volume in a pod. The main Velero backup process creates one or more of these when it finds an annotated pod. Each node in the cluster runs a controller for this resource (in a daemonset) that handles the PodVolumeBackups for pods on that node. The controller executes `restic backup` commands to backup pod volume data.
* `PodVolumeRestore` - represents a restic restore of a pod volume. The main Velero restore process creates one or more of these when it encounters a pod that has associated restic backups. Each node in the cluster runs a controller for this resource (in the same daemonset as above) that handles the `PodVolumeRestores` for pods on that node. The controller executes `restic restore` commands to restore pod volume data.

#### Backup

1. The main Velero backup process checks each pod that it's backing up for the annotation specifying a restic backup should be taken (`backup.velero.io/backup-volumes`)
2. When found, Velero first ensures a restic repository exists for the pod's namespace, by:
  * checking if a `ResticRepository` custom resource already exists
  * if not, creating a new one, and waiting for the `ResticRepository` controller to init/check it
3. Velero then creates a `PodVolumeBackup` custom resource per volume listed in the pod annotation
4. The main Velero process now waits for the `PodVolumeBackup` resources to complete or fail
5. Meanwhile, each `PodVolumeBackup` is handled by the controller on the appropriate node, which:
  * has a hostPath volume mount of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to access the pod volume data
  * finds the pod volume's subdirectory within the above volume
  * runs `restic backup`
  * updates the status of the custom resource to `Completed` or `Failed`
6. As each `PodVolumeBackup` finishes, the main Velero process adds it to the Velero backup in a file named `<backup-name>-podvolumebackups.json.gz`. This file gets uploaded to object storage alongside the backup tarball. It will be used for restores, as seen in the next section.

#### Restore

1. The main Velero restore process checks each existing `PodVolumeBackup` custom resource in the cluster to backup from.
2. For each `PodVolumeBackup` found, Velero first ensures a restic repository exists for the pod's namespace, by:
  * checking if a `ResticRepository` custom resource already exists
  * if not, creating a new one, and waiting for the `ResticRepository` controller to init/check it (note that in this case, the actual repository should already exist in object storage, so the Velero controller will simply check it for integrity)
3. Velero adds an init container to the pod, whose job is to wait for all restic restores for the pod to complete (more on this shortly)
4. Velero creates the pod, with the added init container, by submitting it to the Kubernetes API
5. Velero creates a `PodVolumeRestore` custom resource for each volume to be restored in the pod
6. The main Velero process now waits for each `PodVolumeRestore` resource to complete or fail
7. Meanwhile, each `PodVolumeRestore` is handled by the controller on the appropriate node, which:
  * has a hostPath volume mount of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods` to access the pod volume data
  * waits for the pod to be running the init container
  * finds the pod volume's subdirectory within the above volume
  * runs `restic restore`
  * on success, writes a file into the pod volume, in a .velero subdirectory, whose name is the UID of the Velero restore that this pod volume restore is for
  * updates the status of the custom resource to `Completed` or `Failed`
8. The init container that was added to the pod is running a process that waits until it finds a file within each restored volume, under `.velero`, whose name is the UID of the Velero restore being run
9. Once all such files are found, the init container's process terminates successfully and the pod moves on to running other init containers/the main containers.

## Kubernetes cluster BUR Process with Restic Integration

We can backup Kubernetes cluster regularly and restore it when disaster happens as below:

1. Add annotations for pods with persistent volumes by hand
2. Create velero backup(including pods and relevant volumes) for the cluster
3. Delete the whole Kubernetes cluster(simulate a disaster)
4. Install a new Kubernetes Cluster and velero with the same storage provider as before
5. Wait velero backup to appear in the new Kubernetes cluster
6. Do velero restore
7. Check the new Kubernetes cluster state(Kuberentes data&&Application data) - whether or not the same state as before

## Some thought about velero with Restic Integration

* Incremental backup

An incremental backup chain will be maintained across pod reschedules for PVCs. However, for pod volumes that are not PVCs, such as emptyDir volumes, when a pod is deleted/recreated (e.g. by a ReplicaSet/Deployment), the next backup of those volumes will be full rather than incremental, because the pod volume's lifecycle is assumed to be defined by its pod.

* Application influence during backup

There is no influence since the application is completely unaware of the restic backup, but the possibility of inconsistency of data always exists.
  
* Performance
 
Restic scans each file in a single thread. This means that large files (such as ones storing a database) will take a long time to scan for data deduplication, even if the actual difference is small.

## Advanced research for velero with Restic Integration

#### *Multiple Pods with velero restic backup annotation backend with same PersistentVolumeClaims*

velero restic will backup the `PersistentVolumeClaims` only once when there are multiple backup annotations backend with the same `PersistentVolumeClaims` as below:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f examples/nginx-app/with-pv.yaml -ntest
$ kubectl scale --replicas=3 deploy/nginx-deployment -ntest
$ kubectl get pods -ntest
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

#### *[velero-volume-controller](https://github.com/duyanghao/velero-volume-controller)* 

Since one drawback of velero with Restic Integration is that we have to add relevant annotation for pods with persistent volumes by hand for backing up application data and meanwhile the velero official hasn't offered a solution yet.

To solve this, I have created a repo called [velero-volume-controller](https://github.com/duyanghao/velero-volume-controller), which helps users to do this dull job automatically as below:

![](/public/img/velero/velero-volume-controller.png)  

#### *Create regularly scheduled backups based on a cron expression*

Let's do a simple test for regularly scheduled backups:

```bash
$ velero schedule create backup-tutorial --schedule="*/2 * * * *"
$ velero schedule get  
NAME              STATUS    CREATED                         SCHEDULE      BACKUP TTL   LAST BACKUP   SELECTOR

$ velero backup get

```

#### *Switch between underlying storage providers*

```bash
$ kubectl get sc      
NAME            PROVISIONER       AGE
storage-provider1          provisioner/storage-provider1   5h7m
storage-provider2 (default)   provisioner/storage-provider2     23m
# create nginx with persistent volume based on storage-provider1
# delete storage-provider1 and rename storage-provider2 to storage-provider1
$ kubectl get sc      
NAME            PROVISIONER       AGE
storage-provider1          provisioner/storage-provider2   25m
$ kubectl delete ns nginx-example
# restore(from storage-provider1 to storage-provider2 persistent volume)
$ velero restore create --from-backup bur-backup --include-namespaces nginx-example
$ velero restore get
NAME                        BACKUP       STATUS      WARNINGS   ERRORS   CREATED                         SELECTOR
bur-backup-20200325170537   bur-backup   Completed   0          0        2020-03-25 17:05:37 +0800 CST   <none>
# check nginx-example state - ok
```

As you can can, the requirements for switching between underlying storage providers list below:

1. Same StorageClassName 
2. Support relevant access modes of persistent volume(i.e. RWO, ROX and RWX)

#### *[Backup Big Data](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/1515)*

When backing up big data, such as 100G or more, velero backup will fail as below: 

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test100g bs=1M count=102400
$ kubectl cp test100g test/nginx-deployment-7f6f89ddbf-lq245:/var/log/nginx/

The default value of restic_timeout is one hour. We can increase this for large migrations, keeping in mind that a higher value may delay the return of error messages.

```bash
# increase the timeout value -- under the args section of the velero deployment as below:
[...truncate...]
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - server
        - --restic-timeout=3h
        command:
        - /velero
```

Now restic backup successfully as below:

```bash
$ velero backup get
